This site documents my hands-on learning journey in cybersecurity.

Here I share notes, practical labs, writeups, certification experiences, and technical reflections across offensive and defensive security domains.

The goal of this portfolio is to show how I approach problems, learn new concepts, and continuously improve my technical skills.

Content will evolve over time as I gain more experience and explore different areas of cybersecurity.
